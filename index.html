								<h3><a href="https://github.com/jwolski7/MVCMountainsAppPublic">Snow Resort Dashboard</a></h3>
								<h6>ASP.NET Core MVC, C#, Visual Studio 2022, Microsoft SQL Server, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, API</h6>
								<p>This is a web app I created to display statistical data about the snowfall that happens at popular 
									ski resorts in my province. I used ASP.NET Core MVC as my framework, C# and SQL to program the backend and some 
									HTML, CSS and JavaScript to program the frontend. The data I am using is collected using an API that 
									returns a JSON file. I then extract specific data from  the JSON file and store it in a Microsoft SQL Server 
									database. The way I am connecting to the database is through Dapper. The way the dashboard works is by 
									retrieving data from the database, grouping the data for certain time frames, and then displaying the data 
									in several charts. The charts can then be interacted with by using year and month filters to see how the 
									snowfall changes through the years and months. The dashboard was created using Google Charts, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
									This is a public version that has sensitive information removed, so it will not run as it stands. However, it should be 
									enough to get a general understanding of how things operate. Also I do have a private version that does run.

								<h3><a href="https://github.com/jwolski7/AndroidSchedulingApp">Android Scheduling App</a></h3>
								<h6>Android Studio, Java, SQLite, Git</h6>
								<p>This is an android app that was built to assist with scheduling employee shifts for each month.
									The app was built following the specifications of a Food Court manager that one of my 
									University Professors knew. This was a term long group project where we used Scrum 
									Framework to assign team members task to accomplish and keep track of how the app was progressing. 
									This app was built in Android Studio and Java was the programming language used to code the app. 
									Data for this app was stored in an SQLite database.

								<h3><a href="https://github.com/jwolski7/Mail-Application">Mail Application</a></h3>
								<h6>Python, Linux, VSCode, IPv4, TCP</h6>
								<p>This is a command line application that was created to allow multiple users to send messages to 
									one another while being signed in on the same server. Each user used a different IPv4 address to 
									connect to the server through TCP protocols. This application was programmed using Python and ran on linux 
									servers, allowing the server to use the fork command to create multiple processes. This app accounted 
									for some Cyber Security attacks(e.g. Man-in-the-Middle attack) as this project was part of 
									a Networks course.

								<h3><a href="https://github.com/jwolski7/PropertyAssessmentApp">Desktop Application</a></h3>
								<h6>Java, JavaFX, IntelliJ, Scene Builder</h6>
								<p>This is a GUI application that was created to filter and display assessment data about Edmonton Properties.
									This application was programmed using Java with a focus on using object-oriented design patterns to organize 
									the code. The JavaFX software was used in conjunction with Scene Builder to build the application as a dashboard where 
									data could be filtered and displayed as just statistical numbers, or visual charts.
